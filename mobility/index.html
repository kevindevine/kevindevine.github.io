        <p>The purpose on these exercises is to improve strength & articular resilience. Very often, poor mobility is down to weakness in our end ranges. The exercises are targeting your end ranges.
        
        You may find these difficult. Push this as much as you can. Pain free. The body gets good at what you do. Focus on good, quality movement of each joint.. Use the charts (attached) for reps/sets & to plot progress.

            Training the feet & ankles may be new to you. You may struggle at first to get the hang of some of the drills.
            
            Be consistent. Everyday.
            
            Pick a couple of the foot strengthening drills that you find particularly difficult & focus on them for a few weeks.
            
            Change as you see fit.
            
            Introduce the movements throughout your day to gain even more control.
            
            We encourage you to go barefoot around your home as much as possible.
            
            As always - pain free movement.

            The purpose of these exercises is to improve strength & articular resilience. The exercises are targeting your end ranges at a more progressive level then Phase 1.
            
            Feel free to push these movements as much as you want.
            
            Remember - flirt with & embrace the cramp. As long as the movements are pain free.
            
            Work as hard as you can.
