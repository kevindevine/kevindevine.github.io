            <p class="intro">Design Director at NearForm, a remote-first digital company founded in Tramore, Waterford. I work closely with colleagues and clients throughout the project lifecycle to deliver useful and usable solutions for people. I loves the challenge of designing for global audiences and particularly the early phases of facilitating discovery workshops to kick things off.</p>
            
            <p>I'm currently working with the good folk at <a href="http://nearform.com">NearForm</a>, , <a href="#">Link</a>. </p>
            
            <p>I'm based in Ireland where I work remotely. I do love catching up with the community in person when possible, </p>
            
            <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
            <p class="story first"><strong>1990s</strong> I grew up on Prince Edward Island in Canada. My older brother Peter was a nerd and my mother was very supportive, so I was privileged enough to have a computer around the house in my teens and started hacking on projects. In school, I even won a prize in a Remembrance Day website contest by <a href="https://www.veterans.gc.ca/">Veterans Affairs Canada</a> &#8212; my own legit copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CorelDRAW">Corel Draw</a>!</p>
            
            <p class="story"><strong>1996</strong> When I was 16, my twin brother Nicholas and I started a web design agency called <a href="http://www.whitelands.com">Whitelands Studio</a> with our high school friends in order to make money in preparation for university. We got paid to digitize the collections of local museums, such as The Potato Museum in Tignish and the Fisheries Museum in Basin Head, PEI.</p>
            
            <p class="story"><strong>1999</strong> That company became <a href="http://silverorange.com/">silverorange</a> in 1999. We learned the ropes and worked on notable projects like the <a href="https://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/branding-firefox">Firefox brand</a> and <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> website. I'm increasingly proud that silverorange is still going strong and changing the world for the better, one project at a time &#8212; we celebrated 20 years in business in 2019.</p>

            <p class="story"><strong>2005</strong> I was lured to Silicon Valley by <a href="http://kevinrose.com">Kevin Rose</a> to be the creative director of the news pioneer <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>. For five years, we broke ground in the way news was shared online. Kevin and I also co-founded the social network <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pownce">Pownce</a> with Leah Culver, which we sold to Six Apart.</p>
            
            <p class="story"><strong>2010</strong> I left at the zenith of Digg and Stewart Butterfield brought me on as director of design on the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_(video_game)">Glitch</a>. God bless Stewart and the team... I left after a year because I wasn't satisfied in the game design world, and they went on to turn Glitch into the rocket ship <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a>. Slack was a game? Yep, it doesn't make sense to anyone else either.</p>
            
            <p class="story"><strong>2011</strong> Kevin Rose and I then started an incubator company called Milk, which we sold to <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> a year later. I spent the next five years as a design partner at <a href="http://gv.com">Google Ventures</a>, where I got to work with a huge variety of companies like <a href="http://flatiron.com">Flatiron Health</a>, <a href="http://flyzipline.com">Zipline</a>, <a href="http://farmersbuisnessnetwork.com">Farmers Business Network</a>, <a href="http://bluebottle.com">Blue Bottle Coffee</a>, and many others. I also had the chance to contribute to the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/1442397683"><em>Sprint</em></a> with my colleagues Jake, John, Braden, and Michael.</p>
            
            <p class="story"><strong>2016</strong> While visiting Lima, Peru, I met the founding team of the not-for-profit <a href="https://www.laboratoria.la/en">Laboratoria</a> in 2015 and in 2016, I joined the board of directors.</p>
            
            <p class="story"><strong>2018</strong> I was introduced to former <a href="http://cdc.gov">CDC</a> director Dr. Tom Frieden and soon joined his team at <a href="http://resolvetosavelives.org">Resolve to Save Lives</a> to build a tech team to support large scale hypertension control programs. We started the <a href="https://simple.org">Simple</a> open-source project and piloted it in Punjab, India in 2019. Simple quickly grew to an international effort in thousands of hospitals and clinics.</p>
            
            <p class="story"><strong>2020</strong> Along with my ongoing work at <a href="http://resolvetosavelives.org">Resolve to Save Lives</a>, I volunteered with <a href="https://projectN95.org">Project N95</a> to help get personal protective equipment (PPE) to healthcare workers who needed it most, during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
            
            <p class="story"><strong>2021</strong> On the side, I started the <a href="https://healthicons.org">Health icons</a> project, where a big group of wonderful volunteers has created hundreds of icons as a public good for health projects anywhere in the world. I also joined the board of <a href="https://loophealth.com">Loop Health</a>, a fantastic India-based start-up in which I invested.</p>
            
            <p class="story"><strong>2022</strong> Today, I spend almost all of my time at <a href="http://resolvetosavelives.org">Resolve to Save Lives</a> where I help to lead the <a href="http://simple.org">Simple</a> project, which supports large-scale public health programs in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Ethiopia. In April, a healthcare worker registered the 2-millionth patient into the Simple app. Today, I also serve on the board of the not-for-profit <a href="https://www.laboratoria.la/en">Laboratoria</a> and the health tech startup <a href="https://loophealth.com">Loop Health</a>.</p>
